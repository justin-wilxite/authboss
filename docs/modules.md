# Available Modules

Each module can be turned on simply by importing it and the side-effects take care of the rest.
Not all the capabilities of authboss are represented by a module, see [Use Cases](#use-cases)
to view the supported use cases as well as how to use them in your app.

**Note**: The two factor packages do not enable via side-effect import, see their documentation
for more information.
